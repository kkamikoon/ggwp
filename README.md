# GGWP retrospective technique

---

I recommend applying this `GGWP retrospective technique` when you complete a project in a `Purpose-driven organization` or `Squad-based organization`.
You can also use it to share feedback after completing a long-term project.

# Why?
For the retro-meeting of project, I tried to use existing retrospective techniques such as KPT, AAR, and 4L.
But most techniques do not have any section like `goal` or `purpose`.
A project is a set of tasks that must be completed within a defined timeline to accomplish a specific set of goals.
I believe that if setting up these two components will increase the efficiency of members. And also it improving the level of completion.

# GGWP?
The original GGWP means `"Good Game, Well Played"`. It is kind of meme that used in online games. 
I thought that the project is like a role-playing game where each character has a role and experience the story. Likewise, team members are solve various missions, gain experience and sense of accomplishment.
Therefore, I suggest this retrospective technique, which stands for "I enjoyed the project as a role-playing game".

The GGWP retrospective technique has 4 purposes:

* What is the goal(or your goal) of this project?
* What were the goods to achieve the goal(your goal)?
* What were the weaknesses to achieve the goal(your goal)?
* How can we maintain goods and solve(or prevent) the weaknesses?

Each item in GGWP is as follows:

## Goals
* Goals of project.
* The purpose of setting the goals.
* 'Goods', 'Weaknesses', 'Progresses' will be based on these goals.

## Goods
* What were the good things to achieve the goal(your goal)?
* What you did well throughout the project?
* What you liked about the project?

## Weaknesses
* What were the weak points to achieve the goal(your goal)?
* What were hard things about the project?
* What were bad things about the project?

## Progresses
* What will you keep in 'Goods'?
* What will you try to solve the 'Weaknesses'?
