# GGWP retrospective technique

---

I recommend applying this `GGWP retrospective technique` when you complete a project in a `Purpose-driven organization` or `Squad-based organization`.
You can also use it to share feedback after completing a long-term project.

# Why GGWP?
For the project retro-meeting, I tried to use existing retrospective techniques such as KPT, AAR, and 4L.
But most techniques do not have any section like `goal` or `purpose`.
A project is a set of tasks that must be completed within a defined timeline to accomplish a specific set of goals.
I believe that if setting up these two components will increase the efficiency of members and improve the completion of the project.

## GGWP
The original `GGWP` means `"Good Game, Well Played"`. It is kind of meme used in online games.
Likewise, the project is similar to a story RPG game. Project members are solve various missions, gain experience and sense of accomplishment.
Therefore, I suggest this retrospective technique.

The GGWP retrospective technique has 4 purposes:

* What is the goal(or your goal) of this project?
* What were the goods to achieve the goal(your goal)?
* What were the weaknesses to achieve the goal(your goal)?
* How can we maintain goods and solve(or prevent) the weaknesses?

Each item in GGWP is as follows:

### Goals
* Goals of project.
* The purpose of setting the goals.
* 'Goods', 'Weaknesses', 'Progresses' are based on these goals.

### Goods
* What were the goods to achieve the goal(your goal)?
* What you did well throughout the project?
* What you liked about the project?

### Weaknesses
* What were the weaknesses to achieve the goal(your goal)?
* What were hard things about the project?
* What were bad things about the project?

### Progresses
* Goods에서 계속 유지하면 좋을 내용을 작성합니다.
* Weaknesses를 해결하기 위해 시도할 방법을 작성합니다.
